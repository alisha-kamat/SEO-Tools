# SEO-Tools
This repository only contains the partial code, so it may not work as designed.<br>
The original code, which is still on my laptop, has several additional features as listed below:
- Checking for a single URL
- Checking for multiple URLs
- URL Validation (Pending)
- Evaluating and displaying the count of external nofollow and dofollow links
- Ability to find outgoing links to a specific domain (both nofollow as well as dofollow) (Pending)
<br>
Currently there are no tools that do all of these for free.
